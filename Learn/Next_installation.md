### Module Alias in Next.js (Path Aliases)

If you want to simplify your import paths (e.g., import Component from '../../components/Component' ‚ûù import Component from '@/components/Component'), you can set up path aliases. <br>

### Example
``` jsx
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```
```jsx
import Header from '@/components/Header'
```

### What is an "Alias" (in programming)?

<b>What is an "Alias" (in programming)?<b>

alias gs="git status" // git alisa
import Header from '@/components/Header';// path alias
SELECT name AS employee_name FROM employees;// SQL alisa
import { Component as MyComponent } from 'library'; // Js Library alias
```

```jsx
npm run dev // run the development server
```
### Set up ESLint

```jsx
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
